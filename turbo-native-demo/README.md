# Turbo Native Demo

A small app to demonstrate how to use Turbo with a native app. The demo app is available at [https://turbo-native-demo.glitch.me](https://turbo-native-demo.glitch.me)

## Running Locally

Clone the repo, and then:

```
$ npm install
$ npx nodemon
```

The server is running on [`localhost:45678`](http://localhost:45678). You can open that url in the browser and ensure the native app is using the same url.
